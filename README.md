# Learning ASP.NET Core MVC - Users & Roles (Identity)

Small example showing how to manage basic authentication (cookie based) and authorization (with roles) in an ASP.NET Core MVC app - with Identity support.

This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

Please remember that to start this app, you have to:

- create database by using `Update-Database` (you might need to change the connection string to do that).

More information about Identity in ASP.NET Core MVC can be found here: [ASP.NET Core MVC Login and Registration using Identity](https://youtu.be/CzRM-hOe35o) or here: [ASP.NET Core Identity Tutorial](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/asp-net-core/asp-net-core-identity-tutorial/). Scaffold Identity in ASP.NET Core project is well described here: [Scaffold Identity in ASP.NET Core projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/scaffold-identity?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio).
