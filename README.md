# Learning ASP.NET Core MVC - Users & Roles (Identity)

Small example showing how to manage basic authentication (cookie based) and authorization (with roles) in an ASP.NET Core MVC app - with Identity support.

This sample was created for my own use during lectures, so nothing fancy here :-).

Please remember that to start this app, you have to:

- create database by using `Update-Database` (you might need to change the connection string to do that),
- to login in as a cumstomer you have to use username "jdoe" and password "P@ssw0rd".
